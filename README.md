# Tutorial 0.1: Getting Started!

This repository is used for the first coding assignment in DIG3480.

The steps are outlined both here as well as in the README.md file in the repository.

For this simple introduction to C#, we are going to be working in a pre-created scene provided in this project.

## Configure Bash as Default Shell

For this course, you will be using Bash.

<details>
<summary>Windows
</summary>
For Windows users, you will either have Command Prompt or PowerShell as your default shell. Since you have downloaded Git, you also now have "Git Bash" which uses a command syntax that is more common on Linux systems. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>Mac OSX
</summary>
For Mac, you should already have a Linux-compatible shell. You can run the script by entering:

```bash
./caam register
```

"register" here is a command. You are "telling" the program "caam" to register this repostiory.

You will also want to add "code" to your path.

## Your Friend, `caam`

You will be using the script `caam` to submit assignments. Each time you checkout a repository for the first time, you will enter the "register" command. Then, when you wish to submit your work, you will use the "submit" command.

### Register

`./caam register`

This will configure your repository and enable you to submit.

### Submit

`./caam submit`

### Results

`./caam results`
